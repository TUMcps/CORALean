# `D̃^(-1/2)` at an uncertain degree, as an affine function of the edge factors

The inverse square root of node `j`'s degree, read through a `Relaxation` at the
box `[degree, degreeSup]` that node's degree is known to sit in. What comes
back is a slope, an offset and an error, and composing the slope with the affine
`degreeAt` of `degreeAt_eq` leaves `s_j` affine in the edge weights again:

    s_j = sqrtConst + Σₑ sqrtEdgeCoeff ⬝ αₑ + (residual, at most aux_sqrtError)

`sqrt_affine` is that identity, stated at the factors `α = 2λ - 1` the uncertain
adjacency already uses, so the two sets share their factors and a product of
them keeps the dependence. The residual is not here: it is a factor of its own,
one per node, and only the enclosure that spends it knows how many nodes there
are to spend it on.
